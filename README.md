===================
 
# Content and documentation#
This folder contains the first release of the EnergyScope model adapted to the French case.   
More recent releases are available @ the EnergyScope project repository: https://github.com/energyscope/EnergyScope   
This version of the model is an extension of the one in [4].  
The data and formulation are available here:
	https://energyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Do refer to the documentation for:
- Model formulation
- Data used and sources
- License
- Get started
- Previous versions
